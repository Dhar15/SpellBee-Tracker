## 🧠 How It Works

- `content.js`: Injected into the Spelling Bee page. Tracks guessed words and extracts the hints table.
- `background.js`: Stores the word counts and hint data in `chrome.storage.local`.
- `popup.html` + `popup.js`: Display the live table and heatmap when you click the extension icon.

## 🛡 Permissions

- `storage`: Used to persist your progress
- `https://spellbee.org/*`: Extension only activates on the Spelling Bee website

No trackers. No data collection. Fully offline.

## 🛠 Developer Notes
